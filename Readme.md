This my practice for the [Classes and Objects tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp/tutorials/intro-to-csharp/introduction-to-classes).

## Key Features

This sample demonstrates introduction of object oriented programming with classes and objects in C#, which explains about creation and usage of classes, objects, constructors, properties and methods.

## Build and Run

To build and run the sample, type the following two commands:

```dotnetcli
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

`dotnet restore` restores the dependencies for this sample.

`dotnet run` builds the sample and runs the output assembly.
